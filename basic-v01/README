Deltafab - Plain, no bearing version.

This is a work in progress. You could most likely build this as is, but there is much that can be improved first. I have printed a few parts to test fit everything and make improvements. By no means will deltabots initially have the quality of a cartesian printer. There is a lot to be learned and figured out.

I am asking that nobody work on the openscad source beyond what I have done. I will continue work later in the year. I say this because I understand how frustrating it is to have made "improvements" to a project, and the owner picks up work again without yours.
